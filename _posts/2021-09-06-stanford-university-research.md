This summer, I had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do research in one of the most exciting areas of bioengineering 
at a top research university. So I figured I'll share my findings and thoughts about it.

Just a quick takeaway: doing research is awesome and everyone should try to do some in the field they are excited about.

## Overview

This summer I worked as a *research assistant* at **Stanford University, [Huang Lab](http://www.proteindesign.org/)**.
I conducted research in protein sequence design, expanding on the lab's **Deep Learning** project called the **[Protein Sequence Design Algorithm](https://github.com/ProteinDesignLab/protein_seq_des)**
and experimenting with it to build *internal hydrogen bonding networks[^1]*.

The result was a poster titled 
*[Building Hydrogen Bonding Networks with Protein Sequence Design Model](https://temir.dev/projects/rosetta-poster/poster)* and presented at **[Summer RosettaCON 2021](http://www.rosettadesigngroup.com/rosettacon/)**.

[^1]: Hydrogen bond is a type of chemical interaction between two atoms that have positive and negative charges. Protein cores do not usually have hydrogen bonds because the amino acids inside tend to be hydrophobic, which means they do not carry charge. Internal hydrogen bonding networks are therefore unusual for proteins and show how much *specificity* the project I have worked on can bring to protein design.
